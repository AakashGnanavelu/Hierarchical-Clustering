# Hierarchical-Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is a machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points together in a dataset. It works by creating a hierarchical tree-like structure of clusters that can be visualized as a dendrogram.

Imagine you have a dataset of customer information including age, income, and spending habits, and you want to group customers into different segments based on their spending patterns. Hierarchical clustering can help you to group similar customers together and identify different customer segments.

In hierarchical clustering, the algorithm starts by treating each data point as its own cluster. The algorithm then combines the two closest clusters into a new cluster and repeats this process until all data points are in a single cluster. This creates a dendrogram, which is a tree-like structure that shows the relationships between the clusters at different levels of the hierarchy.

There are two main types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as its own cluster and combines the two closest clusters into a new cluster. Divisive clustering starts with all data points in a single cluster and recursively divides the clusters into smaller clusters.

Once the hierarchical structure is created, you can choose to cut the dendrogram at a certain level to create a desired number of clusters. This allows you to identify different groups of customers based on their spending patterns.

Hierarchical clustering is a useful tool for identifying patterns and relationships in data. It is commonly used in biology, social sciences, and image processing. However, it can be computationally intensive and may not always produce optimal results. Overall, hierarchical clustering is a powerful tool for grouping similar data points together and visualizing the relationships between different clusters in a dataset.
